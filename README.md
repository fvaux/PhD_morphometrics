# PhD_morphometrics
R scripts for 2D landmark-based, geometric morphometric analyses conducted on buccinoid true whelk shells (Aeneator, Antarctoneptunea, Kelletia, Penion) and tuatara dentary bones. Scripts are for 3D scatterplots, broken-stick test for PC retention, CVA, mclust, and paleoTS. I recommend checking the original literature and manuals for all called packages.

# Morphometric data for true whelk shells
Sampling information and MorphoJ input files are available here: https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.gqnk98sh6 and http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/kxnfyz73sh.1

# Morphometric data for tuatara dentaries
Sampling information and MorphoJ input files are available here: https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.ms7q2q4

# Photographs and digitisation files
These files are ~175 GB for the true whelks and ~15 GB for the tuatara, and so please contact me to request these files. For further information, including the storage of specimens, please visit: https://sites.google.com/view/evauxlution/data
